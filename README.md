## Project Topic: NFL ProBowl Data Analysis
### Reason
This project is focused on the NFL ProBowl and player statistics.

This topic was selected because the NFL and statistics are a powerful pair in today's market. An efficient model that can make predictions about players is useful and fun for the large majority of people who enjoy football (and sports in general). 

#### Questions we hope to answer
- Using historical NFL statistics and a machine learning model, are we able to predict which player will make the ProBowl?
- Can player statistics provide the necessary data to make a machine learning model? If not, is there a better source of data?

#### Sources and tools
- Project data is from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/ 
- We are using three datasets from 2019 and 2020: passing, rushing, and receiving. These datasets will be cleaned and used as training data.
- Additionally, the 2019 and 2020 ProBowl list of players is used as a reference to test predictions.
