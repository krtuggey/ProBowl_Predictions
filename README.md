## Project Topic: NFL ProBowl Data Analysis
### Reason

During the initial phase of the project and project brainstorming, the team focused on topics that met certain criteria:
- Interesting context and marketable application
- The initial datasets were easily accessible and up to date
- The final project could be completed in a feasible amount of time
- Team members were comfortable with their roles within the project

The NFL ProBowl was chosen as the project focus because:
- The process is interesting and demonstrates the principles we have learned throughout the course
- The data available was vast and accessible
- A machine learning model can be applied effectively

## Source Data Overview

For this analysis, six sets of data from 2019 and 2020 were pulled, cleaned and combined to begin building a linear regression model. 
- 2019 source data: 
  - [2019 NFL Rushing](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/rushing.htm)
  - [2019 NFL Passing](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/passing.htm)
  - [2019 NFL Receiving](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/receiving.htm)
- 2020 source data:
  - [2020 NFL Rushing](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2020/rushing.htm)
  - [2020 NFL Passing](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2020/passing.htm)
  - [2020 NFL Receiving](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2020/receiving.htm)

The data can answer the question: "Can we use historical NFL statistics to effectively predict future ProBowl players?"
